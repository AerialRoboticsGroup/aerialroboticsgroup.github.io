# THIS WEBSITE UNDER DEVELOPMENT

Founded in 2022, we are a brand new lab that exercises basic machine learning research on online, adaptive, and continual reinforcement learning. Our mission is to lift the borders between the training time and the usage time of machine learning algorithms. This way we believe to enable the AI technologies of the future that can perpetually adapt to their users and changing environment conditions throughout their whole life cycle. We define the set of open research questions that hinder real-world use of life-long trainable machine learning artefacts as the adaptive intelligence problem and work hard on solving it.
